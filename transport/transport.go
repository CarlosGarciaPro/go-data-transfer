/*
Package transport defines interfaces for implementing a transport layer for data
transfer. Where the data transfer manager will coordinate setting up push and
pull requests, validation, etc, the transport layer is responsible for moving
data back and forth, and may be medium specific. For example, some transports
may have the ability to pause and resume requests, while others may not.
Some may support individual data events, while others may only support message
events. Some transport layers may opt to use the actual data transfer network
protocols directly while others may be able to encode messages in their own
data protocol.
